# Toy Robot Simulator
This simulator is built with JavaScript and a terminal emulator using React. Ideally it would have been more suitable to choose a backend focused solution with a real terminal. However I went with the stack matching my strengths.

## Show me the simulator
The solution is deployed in Netlify cloud for you to view it in action. Visit this URL https://toy-robot-react.netlify.com/. <br />
If you would like to run it locally, follow these instructions:
1. Open a terminal and switch to project directory
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`
3. Run `npm start` and go to http://localhost:3000 in browser

Further details about available scripts and tests are mentioned below.
